                                    <p>Hi! I am Bhargavi. I’m 28 and I live in Vancouver which is a big city in British Columbia, Canada. I come from a city called Chennai, located in south India where I was born and grew up. I hold a Master’s Degree in Computer Communication from a University in Chennai, India. 

                                        I’m pretty much interested in computers, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers first appeared in my life when I was twelve. Since then I have always been fascinated by it.

                                </div>

                                    <div class="about_me_2_left">
                                        DESIGN <br /> WITH <br /> PASSION
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="about_me_2_right">
                                        <p>Once I completed my Master’s, I managed to get into IBM India Pvt Ltd, a conglomerate. Considering the employee strength, infrastructure and the resources, IBM can literally be compared to an ocean. I started as a Web Developer for an inhouse project. This was basically my first attempt at coding for a client, which was quite exciting and a bit scary in the beginning. IBM gave me the opportunity to learn and grow as a Web Developer and understand the industry standards and ethics.

                                        I was then presented with an opportunity to work for Metlife Insurance, another client of IBM’s. This was again a huge project and had tight deadlines. In the meantime I had also applied for my PR and was waiting for my Visa. </p><br />
                                        
                                        <p>Once I got the Visa, I quit IBM to explore other opportunities. I then arrived in Canada in November 2017. It has been quite a journey so far, even though it has been just a few years since I started my career.
                                        
                                        Hydraulx Vfx (Vancouver), gave me the next big opportunity to work as their Front-End Developer. I started working with new languages and learning things. Since then, it has always been my priority to keep myself updated with trends and technologies.</p>
