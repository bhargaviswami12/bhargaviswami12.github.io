                                    <p>Hi! I am Bhargavi. I’m 28 and I live in Vancouver which is a big city in British Columbia, Canada. I come from a city called Chennai, located in south India where I was born and grew up. I hold a Master’s Degree in Computer Communication from a University in Chennai, India. 

                                        I’m pretty much interested in computer science, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers first appeared in my life when I was twelve. Since then I have always been fascinated by it.

                                        <p>Once I completed my Master’s, I managed to get into IBM India Pvt Ltd, a conglomerate. Considering the employee strength, infrastructure and the resources, IBM can literally be compared to an ocean. I started as a Web Developer for an inhouse project. This was basically my first attempt at coding for a client, which was quite exciting and a bit scary in the beginning. IBM gave me the opportunity to learn and grow as a Web Developer and understand the industry standards and ethics.

                                        I was then presented with an opportunity to work for Metlife Insurance, another client of IBM’s. This was again a huge project and had tight deadlines. In the meantime I had also applied for my PR and was waiting for my Visa. </p><br />
                                        
                                        <p>Once I got the Visa, I quit IBM to explore other opportunities. I then arrived in Canada in November 2017. It has been quite a journey so far, even though it has been just a few years since I started my career.
                                        
                                        Hydraulx Vfx (Vancouver), gave me the next big opportunity to work as their Front-End Developer. I started working with new languages and learning things. Since then, it has always been my priority to keep myself updated with trends and technologies.</p>

                            You already have a 100px header and a margin-top applied to site-content for the content following it, as is usually done.

                            A position: fixed header will be taken out of the flow. So the DOM element following it will overlap.

                            A z-index higher that the surrounding content is given so that it comes on top (which you have done giving wrapper a z-index: 99)

                            The content following it is given a margin-top value. If the height of the header is fixed (as is the case here) you give it using CSS, if the height of the header is dynamic, you might have to opt for javascript to set the height dynamically.

                            So restrict the heights of #global-navigation and .header using height: 100% and add display: flex to the navigation ul. Also remove the absolute positioning of the banner and apply background image to site-content- see demo below:
